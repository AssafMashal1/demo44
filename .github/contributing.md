# Contributing

**Code:** To contribute to our codebase, create a side branch and open a [draft pull request]. Only when all status checks are green, [mark the draft pull request as ready for a review].

**Development Environment:** Referring to [local development documentation](../docs/development/local-development.md) to setup a local development environment and explore the [development folder](../docs/development) for additional guidance.

**Discussion First:** We advise to initiate a [discussion] before delving into development, especially when questions arise about requirements or implementation. This ensures alignment with maintainers on what needs changing and improve the chances of a swift merge. Also, inform the maintainers about your intentions to avoid duplicate efforts.

## Handling Pull Requests

**No Force Push:** Avoid force-pushing to your pull request branch after creating it, as it necessitates a full re-review, making it harder for us to assess changes. We typically squash pull requests when merging, so commit frequently within your branch.

**When Force Pushing is Acceptable:** It's acceptable to force push or use the "Update with rebase" button when:

- Making extensive changes that warrant a full review.
- Syncing your branch with the target branch is more challenging than creating a new pull request.

**Resolve Reviews:** When a maintainer or contributor asks for changes, make them directly instead of merely acknowledging the request. After completing the modifications, use the "[Resolve conversation]" button in the pull request overview instead of posting comments like "I've done the work" or "Done."

**Re-Requesting Review:** Don't ping your reviewer(s) in new comments. Instead, utilize the [re-request a review] functionality.
